<h4>What Are Satellites?</h4>
<p>
Satellites are objects launched into orbit around Earth or other planets to perform various functions. They can be natural, like the Moon, or artificial, like those we launch into space.</p>
<h4>How Do Satellites Work?</h4>
<p>Satellites orbit Earth or another celestial body, transmitting and receiving signals or data. They use onboard sensors and instruments to collect information and then relay it back to ground stations via radio waves. This data is processed and used for various applications, from weather forecasting to global communications.</p>
